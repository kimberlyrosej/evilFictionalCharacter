        <h2>Azarath</h2>
        <p>Azarath is the parallel world and birthplace of Raven. Her mother, Arella, was brought here from Gotham City (under her birth-name, Angela Roth) to hide from Trigon's evil and to shield her only daughter as best she could. It was a peaceful dimension where its residents were taught pacifism, led by their leader Azar, who led the order that originally sealed Trigon into his prison.</p>
        <h2>Arella</h2>
        <p>Arella is a very peaceful, controlled, motherly woman, but also rather fatalistic like her daughter, mainly due to the part she had unwittingly played in Trigon's scheme.
</p>
<p>When the prophecy was about to come to pass, Raven desperately sought out Azarath for help, only to find the city at first apparently deserted. A white dove led Raven to her mother, who could offer neither help nor comfort since the prophecy was inevitable. Right afterwards, it was revealed that the sound state of Azarath had been in fact a cruel illusion: The city was destroyed and in flames, and its people, including Arella, had apparently perished. But after Raven defeated Trigon, she was restored along with Azarath. 

</p>
        <h2>Raven</h2>
        <p>Raven is a half-Azarathian, half-demon hybrid who is one of the five founding members of the Teen Titans.

</p>
<p>Arella, Raven's mother, was chosen to become the bride of the demonic Trigon. Abandoned by the demon, Arella was bent on suicide (while carrying Raven) when she was taken in by the pacifistic disciples of Temple Azarath, a group who had centuries earlier forsaken life on Earth to pursue their own nonviolent lifestyle.

In their inter-dimensional world, Raven, Arella's daughter by Trigon, was born. Fearing that the child would bring evil among them, Juris, a magistrate of Azarath, attempted to cast the infant Raven into Limbo, only to be destroyed himself. Azar, the spiritual leader of the temple, then took the young Raven under her personal tutelage, instructing her in the truth of her parentage, and in pacifism, meditation, and the submergence of her emotions to resist Trigon's influence, while perfecting her powers of teleportation, astral projection, and empathic healing.</p>
