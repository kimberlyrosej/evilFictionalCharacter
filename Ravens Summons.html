		<h2>Ravens Abilities</h2>
    	<ul><li>Darkness/Shadows Control: Raven has the power to create and control the element of pure darkness and shadows and bend it to her will; usually using it in conjunction with her telekinesis.</li>
<li>Soul-Self/Astral Projection: The basis of almost all of Raven's powers are derived from her soul-self. She is able to project her own spirit from her body into a ghostly form, using it to interact with the physical world, affect others mentally, and to traverse through time-space. Her soul-self takes the form of a double of her own body, or more commonly, a large black raven. She is capable of changing its shape and mass at will, and can alter her own appearance with her soul-self, like increasing her size or making her face hideous.[12] She is able to project her soul-self into the minds of others to communicate, facilitate calm or to force people into submission with a devastating mental attack. Though normally composed of energy that is colored black, Raven's soul-self can change color depending on her emotional state, manifesting as red[13] or white.</li>
<li>Advanced Telekinesis: Raven can merge a small part of her soul-self into objects in order to take control of them, with the object essentially becoming an extension of her soul-self;[14] this may be the reason why she prefers to take control of inanimate objects rather than people. The limit to how much matter she is able to control is unknown, though it ranges well into hundreds of tons, allowing her to hurl city buses, mounds of rubble or even uprooting whole slabs of pavement. Whenever she takes control of something, it is covered in the same dark energy that composes her soul-self.</li>
<li>Telekinetic Constructs: With her soul-self able to be molded into any shape, Raven often creates simple domes or walls that act as barriers against attack. She can project solid bolts to be used as projectiles, or a steady stream of solid force. She has been shown making razor-sharp blades[15] to cut through obstacles, claws that can restrain foes, and floating platforms to ride on.</li>
<li>Telekinetic Force-Fields: She can erect unusually strong shields of sheer telekinetic and dark energy around herself and others for protection.</li>
<li>Telekinetic Teleportation: In conjunction with her telekinesis, Raven's soul-self is able to envelop her (along with a max of four other people) and travel to other dimensions, primarily Azarath. She can use this technique to travel vast distances on Earth or to teleport by momentarily displacing herself and then re-appearing in another location. She can pass through walls and obstacles by simply teleporting past them, giving the illusion of intangibility. At times, Raven has been shown creating portals with her dark energy in order to travel, rather than utilizing her soul-self.</li>
<li>Empathy: The psionic ability to sense the emotions of others, allowing her to gain insight into their thoughts and intentions, and even experience their own feelings. This also enables her to sense the mental state of others, as she has stated that she would know if someone's mind had been tampered with.[16] Raven can absorb the pain of others into her own body in order to induce rapid healing for them,[17] and can heal herself by going into a trance of emotional calm. She can receive precognitive flashes of the future when exposed to extreme emotion.[18] By using her empathy to guide her, she can track others with her soul-self. At one point, she had used this ability to empathically enter Robin's subconscious mind; therefore giving the two an unusually strong psychic link afterward.</li>
<li>Levitation: Raven can levitate off the ground and hover, without visible projection of her dark energy as is shown when she utilizes telekinesis. Her power is also sufficient to enable her to counter the gravitational pull of other planets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trigons Relationship With His Daughter/h2>
<p>Trigon is Raven's demonic father. Trigon is an inter-dimensional demon who sought to take over the universe. He is the main antagonist of Season 4 of Teen Titans and is widely considered the most powerful and impure villain of the entire show. He also serves as Raven's arch-nemesis. </p>
<p>His evil nature and lack of concern for anyone else caused him to be hated by his daughter, Raven. She channeled her hatred in to sending him back to his domain at the end of "The End - Part 3." It is unclear whether or not he still exerts any sort of influence on her.</p>
<p>Raven's mental image of Trigon also made an appearance in Teen Titans Go! #5, where her stress, aggravation and frustration caused it to manifest, after being exacerbated by the playful mockery of her zit by the other Titans; this occurred some point after The End, for Cyborg was well aware of the fact that he was called Trigon and he was her father. Raven manages to dispel this form of Trigon through intense joint meditation with her friends. Trigon is also mentioned in Teen Titans Go! #44</p>
